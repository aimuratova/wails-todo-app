# wails-todo-app

This is a simple cross-platform Todo application built with Wails (Go for backend, modern web frontend). It allows you to add, view, and manage your tasks with a clean and minimal interface. The backend is written in Go, while the frontend uses standard web technologies. The app demonstrates how to connect Go logic with a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend using Wails.
